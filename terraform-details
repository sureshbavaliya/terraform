Terraform Basics Presentation
Slide 1: Introduction to Terraform
What is Terraform?
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows users to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using a simple declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).
Founder: Mitchell Hashimoto (2014)
Supported Platforms: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, DigitalOcean, Kubernetes, and more.
Key Features:
•	Cloud-Agnostic: Works across multiple cloud providers.
•	Declarative Approach: Define the desired state, and Terraform automates the changes.
•	State Management: Maintains infrastructure state for accurate tracking and updates.
•	Execution Planning: Preview changes before applying them.
•	Idempotency: Ensures infrastructure changes are applied only if necessary.
•	Automation: Easily integrates with CI/CD pipelines.

2.	Extract the package and add it to your system PATH.
3.	Verify installation using: 
4.	terraform --version

Slide 4: Basic Terraform Workflow
Terraform Workflow Steps:
1.	Write - Define infrastructure in .tf files.
2.	Plan - Preview changes using terraform plan.
3.	Format - Ensure proper formatting using terraform fmt.
4.	Validate - Check for syntax errors using terraform validate.
5.	Apply - Deploy infrastructure using terraform apply.
6.	Destroy - Remove infrastructure using terraform destroy.

Slide 5: Basic Terraform Commands
Essential Terraform Commands
1.	terraform init
o	Definition: Initializes a Terraform working directory by downloading necessary provider plugins and setting up the backend.
o	Usage: Run this command first in a new Terraform project to install dependencies.
2.	terraform plan
o	Definition: Generates and displays an execution plan, showing the changes Terraform will make.
o	Usage: Helps users review modifications before applying them.
3.	terraform apply
o	Definition: Executes the planned changes and provisions the infrastructure.
o	Usage: After reviewing the execution plan, use this command to create or update resources.
4.	terraform destroy
o	Definition: Removes all resources defined in the Terraform configuration.
o	Usage: Use with caution, as it will delete all managed resources.
5.	terraform fmt
o	Definition: Formats Terraform configuration files for readability and best practices.
o	Usage: Ensures consistent style before committing changes.

Slide 6: Terraform on Azure
Step 1: Log in to Azure
Run the following commands to authenticate:
az login
az account set --subscription "<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>"
Step 2: Configure Terraform for Azure
Create a Terraform configuration file (main.tf) with the Azure provider:
provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}

resource "azurerm_resource_group" "example" {
  name     = "myResourceGroup"
  location = "East US"
}
Step 3: Initialize Terraform
Run the following command to initialize the working directory and download necessary plugins:
terraform init
Step 4: Plan the Deployment
Preview the changes before applying them:
terraform plan
Step 5: Apply the Configuration
Create the defined resources in Azure:
terraform apply -auto-approve
